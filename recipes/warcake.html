    <p>This is my Grandmother's recipe for war cake. She used to make it for
        us every summer when we would come home to visit and is a family favorite.
        It's also known as maritime cake or depression cake. The reason being is 
        that it was made back in the great depression and world wars when ingredients
        were either expensive or scarce. This recipe does not use eggs or milk.
