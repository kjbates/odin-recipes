        <p>This recipe is my Aunt and Uncle's pasta sauce and meatball recipe</p>

        <p>This sauce is amazing if left to simmer and doesn't take a lot of effort. 
            It can be either made on the stove or in a slow cooker.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients for Pasta Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lg can tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 lg cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 lg can tomatoes (crush)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili peppers</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp steak spice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients for Meatballs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ lbs. Lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups finely ground cracker crumbs. Oatmeal also works.</li>
            <li>½ cup Kraft parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves chopped fine</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp steak spice</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directions for Pasta Sauce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a good size pot, lightly fry tomato paste with about 1 tablespoon of oil 
                for roughly one minute, making sure you constantly stir.</li>
            <li>Add all the rest of the ingredients. Stir well, bring to a slow boil 
                (be careful not to overdue the heat, it will burn on the bottom and give the 
                sauce a very poor taste).</li>
            <li>Add the meatballs and simmer for four hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Directions for Meatballs:</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>mix all ingredients well, take a seat and roll into desired sized balls</li>
            <li>Place balls on cookie sheet and bake in oven at 350 degrees until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Place meatballs in sauce and boil sauce slowly for 4 hours.</li>
        </ol>
